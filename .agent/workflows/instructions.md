description: General agent instructions for this project

## Rules

1. **Suggest only in chat** — Do NOT directly edit or create files unless the user explicitly says to do so.
2. **Provide code snippets in chat** — Show the user the code they need to copy/paste themselves.
3. **Always read these instructions first** before taking any action on a new request.
4. **Keep code simple** — Prefer straightforward, easy-to-read code over complex or clever solutions. Use simple `if/else` logic instead of ternary expressions or condensed patterns when clarity is at stake.
